### Further Manual Testing

- All pages were tested locally, and on GitHub using Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari. 
- All pages tested for responsivness in different device sizes using Google Chrome Developer Tools;
  - Desktop 
  - iPhone 5/6/7/8/X 
  - iPad 1/2/3/Pro 
  - Galaxy Android phones
- All the pages were also tested manually using;
  - iPhone 5s/6s/8/X/XS/11/
  - Samsung Galaxy S8/Note 10+
  - iPad Air 2 
- All the internal links tested locally, and functional.
- All the logos on the website are functional, and leads the user back to the home page. 
- All external links works as expected, and open in a new tab. 
- All images are properly sized, and contain 'alt' text for description.
- All the buttons checked for functionality, and works as expected. 
- All the links in mobile navbar works, and navbar works as expected.
- All the fields in the contact form, as well as the submit button are tested, and working properly. Contact form also uses POST method linked to Code Institute form dump for input validation. 

### Debugging

- During the earlier development stages of the website, a custom [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) map was used for the Contact page to improve the UI. After testing the page on various screen sizes, I found out that the map wasn't responsive. During my research i found out that in order to make a Mapbox map responsive, javascript is also needed. Since this was out of the scope of this project, I've decided to use Google Maps which is easier to implement. If you're interested in using Mapbox maps on your projects, you may find the solution [here.](https://www.codeply.com/go/xVmxfg8AP5/bootstrap-4-mapbox) For more information on how to use Google Maps on your website, you may look [here.](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)

- Some users reported scrolling issues with their mobile devices. To troubleshoot the problem `scroll-behavior` class was removed from the html element in the css. After further testing issue turned out be caused by users' devices, `scroll-behavior` class was added back, and issue was ignored. 

- During the development process, Gitpod servers were experiencing issues, and due these issues parts of this project was pushed using Vscode with "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" extension. After the first commit i've realized that plugin was misconfigured, and this resulted in showing the first, and last name of the author on the commit history, instead of the user name [see here](https://github.com/yigitaksoy/Digital-House/commit/3626b48c32a1467e9cd449afbbc42ae519f389f6). Problem was fixed after proper configuration.
